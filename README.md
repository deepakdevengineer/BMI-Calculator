Repository Name: BMI Calculator

Description:
The BMI Calculator repository is a mobile application project aimed at helping users monitor their body mass index and track their health status over time. The app provides an intuitive user interface to input height and weight data and calculates the BMI based on the chosen units (metric or imperial). It then categorizes the BMI result into various health categories, such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese, according to the WHO standards.

The repository contains the complete source code of the BMI Calculator Android app developed using Java and Android Studio. It also includes any necessary configuration files, resource assets (such as the BMI category images), and the README.md file to provide project documentation and setup instructions for contributors.

Key Features:

Height and Weight Input with customizable units (metric/imperial).
BMI Calculation and Category Classification.
Age and Gender consideration (optional, toggleable in settings).
Local data storage to save user height, weight, and BMI history.
Interactive and user-friendly UI with validation and error handling.
Informative sections about BMI and its significance.
The repository follows best practices for version control, code structure, and modularity. It encourages open-source contributions and aims to continuously improve the app's features and functionalities. Developers interested in contributing to the BMI Calculator project can follow the guidelines provided in the repository's README.md file and submit pull requests to enhance the app further. Together, we aim to create a valuable tool that promotes healthy living and fitness awareness.
