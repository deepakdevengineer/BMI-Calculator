Repository Name: BMI Calculator

**Description:**
The BMI Calculator repository is a mobile application project aimed at helping users monitor their body mass index and track their health status over time. The app provides an intuitive user interface to input height and weight data and calculates the BMI based on the chosen units (metric or imperial). It then categorizes the BMI result into various health categories, such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese, according to the WHO standards.

The repository contains the complete source code of the BMI Calculator Android app developed using Java and Android Studio. It also includes any necessary configuration files, resource assets (such as the BMI category images), and the README.md file to provide project documentation and setup instructions for contributors.
